# Fast Backups

*Fast, incremental Minecraft world backups powered by Git*

Fast Backups (FastBack, for short) is a Fabric Minecraft mod that backs up your world in incremental snapshots.  When it does a backup, it only saves the parts of your world that changed.

This means backups are fast.  It also means you can keep snapshots of your world without using up a lot
of disk space.

## Features

* Works on Linux, Mac and Windows
* ..all with easy-to-use minecraft commands
