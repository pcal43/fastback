# Permissions

In single-player mode, `/backup` can be run without enabling cheats.

On a dedicated server, `/backup` can be run only by level 4 operators.

FastBack exposes fine-grained permissions via
the [fabric-permissions-api](https://github.com/lucko/fabric-permissions-api)
so that you can do access control in [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/).

Supported Permissions:
