# FastBack
*Fast, incremental Minecraft world backups powered by Git*

Fastback is a Minecraft mod that backs up your world in incremental snapshots.  When it does a backup,
it only saves the parts of your world that changed.  

This means backups are fast.  It also means you can keep snapshots of your world without using up a lot
of disk space.

## Features

* **Now with Forge support!**
* Incrementally backup just the changed files
* Faster, smaller backups than zipping
* Back up locally
* Back up remotely to any git server
* Back up remotely to any network volume (no git server required)
* Schedule backups to run automatically
* Easily restore backup snapshots
* Snapshot pruning, retention policies
* Include mod jars and config files in backup snapshots
* Broadcast server-wide notifications during backups 
* LuckPerms support
* Works on clients and dedicated servers
* Works on Linux, Mac and Windows
* ..all with easy-to-use minecraft commands


## Road Map
* Support for restoring remote snapshots
* Better management of remote snapshots
* UI for managing backups from the title screen
* ~~Forge support (maybe)~~
